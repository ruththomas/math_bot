#### Adding a level

1) Add a file to the assets directory
    - File name must match the level name
    
2) Copy this json into the file
```
{
  "level": "<{string}LEVEL NAME (MUST MATCH FILE NAME)>",
  "prevLevel": "<{string}PREVIOUS LEVEL NAME (IF NONE TYPE "None">",
  "nextLevel": "<{string}NEXT LEVEL NAME (IF NONE TYPE "None">",
  "show": <{boolean}(If the level's previous is "None" this field must be true)>, 
  "steps": {}
}
```

3) Fill out the json

#### Adding steps to the level

1) Add this json to the `"steps"` field 

```$xslt
 "<NAME OF STEP (must start with a capital and be camel cased)>": {
      "level": "<{string}LEVEL NAME (must match the level name exactly)>",
      "step": "<{string}MUST MACH NAME OF STEP EXACTLY>",
      "gridMap": <{array[string]}SEE `Creating a Grid Map` SECTION>,
      "description": <{string}SEE `Creating a Description` SECTION>, 
      "mainMax": <{int}<ALLOWABLE COMMANDS IN MAIN (if infinite -1)>,
      "robotOrientation": <{int}ROBOTS STARTING ORIENTATION (0, 90, 180, 270 ~ only)>,
      "stagedEnabled": <{boolean}INDICATES IF THE USER IS ABLE TO OPEN THE STAGED FUNCTION POPOVER>,
      "activeEnabled": <{boolean}INDICATES IF THE USER CAN ADD ANYTHING TO ACTIVE FUNCTIONS (almost always true)>,
      "stagedQty": <{int}QTY OF STAGED FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE (if infinite -1)>,
      "assignedStaged": <{list[object]}SEE `Adding Assigned Staged` SECTION>,
      "preBuiltActive": <{list[object]}SEE `Adding Pre-Built Actives` SECTION>,
      "allowedActives": <{list[string]}LIST OF FUNCTION CREATED IDS (only applies to built functions)>,
      "cmdsAvailable": <{array[string]}ARRAY OF COMMAND NAMES, SEE `Command Names` SECTION FOR COMMAND NAMES>,
      "specialParameters": <{array[string]}LIST OF SPECIAL PARAMETERS, SEE `Special Parameters` SECTION FOR CURRENT SPECIAL PARAMETERS>,
      "problem": <{string}SEE `Building a Problem` SECTION FOR PROPER PROBLEM SYNTAX,
      "clearMain": <{boolean>INDICATES IF MAIN SHOULD BE EMPTY AT THE START OF THE LEVEL>,
      "initFocus": <{array[string]}LIST OF ELEMENTS TO ADD SPECIAL EFFECT ON AT START OF STEP, SEE `Init Focus` SECTION>
      "videoHints": <{array[string]}LIST OF YOUTUBE VIDEO IDS>,
      "freeHint": <{option[string]}YOUTUBE VIDEO ID THAT PLAYS AT THE BEGGINING OF LEVEL AUTOMATICALLY>,
      "prevStep": <{String}PREVIOUS STEP NAME (Should be "None" if first step)>,
      "nextStep": <{String}NEXT STEP NAME (Should be "None" if last step)>
    },
```

#### Command Names 
* Command names can also be found in `app/model/DefaultCommands.scala`

```$xslt
  "changeRobotDirection"
  "moveRobotForwardOneSpot"
  "setItemDown"
  "pickUpItem"
```

#### Creating a Grid Map
* Legend
  
```$xslt
(R) - Robot Spot
($) - Portal
|E|	- Robot can go
|W|	- Robot can't go
[1]	- Self replenishing - value 1
[10] - Self replenishing - value 10
[100] - Self replenishing - value 100
[1g] - Self replenishing - value 1,000
[10g] - Self replenishing - value 10,000
[TS(<TOOL>,<TOOL>)] - None self replenishing tools (comma sperated, no spaces) - e.g [TS(1,10,100,1g,10g)]
```
* Grid map creation
    * Use the above legend to fill in the grid map
    * We have only extensively tested a 5 x 10 grid however the grid can be any dimension! 
```$xslt
[
    "[1]   |E| |E| |E| |E| |E| |E| |E| |E| |E|",
    "[10]  |E| |E| |E| |E| |E| |W| |W| |W| |W|",
    "[100] |E| |E| |E| |E| |E| |W| |E| |E| |E|",
    "[1g]  |E| |E| |E| |E| ($) |W| |E| |E| |E|",
    "[10g] |E| |E| |E| |E| (R) |W| |E| |E| |E|"
]
```

#### Creating a Description
* Include the following in the description to be converted 
```$xslt
!!P!! - includes built problem in description
!!L!! - includes level name in description
!!S!! - includes step name in description
!![img]src='<IMG SRC (Must be in single quotes)>'!! - include an image in description, will be same size as font
```

#### Adding Assigned Staged
* Adds specified staged functions to staged functions
1) Add image resource url in `ui/src/assets/assets.js` to `funcImages`
    
2) Add assigned staged object to JSON scala case class located ar `app/actors/messages/AssignedFunctionModel.scala`
```$xslt
[
    {
        "name": <{string}DISPLAY NAME>,
        "image": <{string}NAME OF IMAGE IN ASSETS>,
        "createdId": <{string}CREATED ID, 11 DIGIT STRING OF NUMBERS STARTING WITH 5 (generate using random.org)>,
        "sizeLimit": <{int}MAX SIZE FUNCTION CAN BE>,
        "func": <{list[string]}MUST BE AN EMPTY ARRAY>,
    }
]
```

#### Special Parameters 
* These are special requirements beyond the regular requirements (see `Game Rules to Pass a Step`) to pass this step

Current Special Parameters
```$xslt
    "functionRequired" - user must use a built function
    "recursionRequired" - user must use recursion (currently only checks top level)
```

#### Building a Problem
* {int} - becomes an integer with that many digits
* int - becomes self
```$xslt
"{1} + {2} * ({6} - {4}) - 55" == "4 + 65 * (123456 - 4513) - 55"
```

#### Adding Pre-built Actives;
* Active functions already built for the user
```$xslt
[
    {
        "name": <{string}DISPLAY NAME>,
        "image": <{string}NAME OF IMAGE IN ASSETS>,
        "createdId": <{string}CREATED ID, 11 DIGIT STRING OF NUMBERS STARTING WITH 5 (generate using random.org)>,
        "sizeLimit": <{int}MAX SIZE FUNCTION CAN BE>,
        "func": <{list[string]}LIST OF COMMANDS (see 'command names' section}>,
    }
]
```

#### Init Focus
* Elements to alert the user of when the step loads
* Elements will flash twice in the order they are found in the array
* Helpful to demonstrate what order things must happen to pass the level
* Name becomes the corresponding id on the front end either by becoming the hashed value, or literal
```$xslt
    # Commands - will be hashed into the corresponding id
        > changeRobotDirection
        > moveRobotForwardOneSpot
        > setItemDown
        > pickUpItem
    # Functions - will be hashed into the corresponding id
        > Use the functions `name`
    # Other elements - will be converted into the correct id name
        > main-placeholder (only visible when main max set)
        > staged (green + that opens staged functions)
```
